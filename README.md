# Json module

The Json module was created by copying over the Qt Json library and altering the code to work with decimals. The decimal classes were taken from ttmath.

The latest commit where the original files remain untouched is: 6fb0f1dfe
To see what changes were made to make the library work, run `git diff 6fb0f1dfe..445b4b338 -- modules/Json/`.
